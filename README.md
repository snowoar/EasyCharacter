# EZCharacter
Generated by [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) 7.5.1.

## Getting Started
To use EasyCharacter, head to Releases and download the latest version of the rbxm.

### Differences
With EasyCharacter
```lua
--server script
local Players = game:GetService("Players")
local EasyCharacter = require(path.to.EasyCharacter)

Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(EasyCharacter)

--local script
local EasyCharacter = require(ReplicatedStorage.Shared.EasyCharacter)

EasyCharacter(Player, function()
	print("Character added for local player:", Player.Name)
	-- You can add more logic here to handle the character
end)
```

Without EasyCharacter
```lua
--server script
local Players = game:GetService("Players")

local function onCharacterAdded(char : Model)
        print("this is getting pretty messy already")
end

Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
	player.CharacterAdded:Connect(onCharacterAdded)

        --init at the bottom incase server didnt get that line above
        if player.Character then 
                onCharacterAdded(player.Character)
        end
end)

--local script
local Player = game.Players.LocalPlayer

local function onCharacterAdded(character : Model)
        print("this is stuff happens when the character is added")
end

Player.CharacterAdded:Connect(onCharacterAdded)

if Player.Character then
        onCharacterAdded(Player.Character)
end
```
Before you criticize on why this module looks useless, I made this for some personal projects. I decided to make this open-source because there was no reason not to.
